# Kickstart Excel Challenge
## Project Objective
The purpose of this challenge to organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects from Kickstart in order to uncover hidden trends.

## Methods Used
•	Cleaning Data
•	Conditional Formatting
•	Pivot Table
•	Formulas
•	Charts and Graphs
•	Statistical Analysis 

## Technology
•	Microsoft Excel

## Project Description
### Using the 4,000 datasets of the Kickstart Challenge, I uncover some market trends:

•	On the spreadsheet, I used conditional formatting to fill each cell in the state column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, canceled or is currently live.

•	For Data Visualization, I create a new sheet with a pivot table that will analyze the count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled or is currently live.

## 1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
•	There is a total of 4114 campaign, out of the three categories: failed, live & successful. 
  Successful has the most out of the three categories
  
•	Electronic Music is a good investment (40 successful out of 40 total) no fails

•	Investment in the food campaign did not yield return (140 fail out of 200) = 70% fail rates

## 2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
•	Most of the campaigns are from the US (about 3000), hard to compare other countries to the US.  Maybe need more campaigns from other countries so that the data can be more comparable 

•	Need more data to see why the campaign fail or successful so investors can have an idea for future campaign investments
